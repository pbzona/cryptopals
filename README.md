# Cryptopals Solutions

These are my solutions to the Cryptopals cryptography challenges in Go. Solutions are written out at length to show thought process - there are almost certainly more efficient ways of solving each challenge, so don't use mine as a model :)

**Don't look in this project if you don't want to see the solutions. If you're going through the challenges, seek help in other ways before looking at completed problems.**

I'm not affiliated with Cryptopals and did not create any of these challenges myself, and I'm only including challenge texts themselves so that I can have a local copy to work from offline. Original challenges and more info can be found on the [Cryptopals site](https://cryptopals.com/).
